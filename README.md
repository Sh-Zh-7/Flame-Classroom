## Note

This project is only a **semi-finished** product. It can't even guarantee that you can run it immediately, so we are adding more complex logic and features to this code.

The biggest disadvantage of this product is **the problem of architecture**. Live broadcast requires high-performance and high bandwidth servers, but we **don't have the money** to implement it. So we regard the teacher end as a server which is a very dirty implementation, for a lot of information have to be stored in teacher’s computer.
